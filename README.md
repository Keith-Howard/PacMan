# PacMan
<img src="bostonMapScreenshot.JPG" width='300'/>

This was an assignment for MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Developmen with MERN. The Majority of the code was provided. I had to write a function that would detect when the Pack Man hit a wall. My Function took into accoun the Pac Man's size and the size of the window and made boundaries and then changed the direction for when the Pac Man hit a boundary.

# Installation
To run this program
- download the JavaScript, HTML and CSS files.
- downloand the folder with the Pac Man pictures in it and keep it in the same directory as   the other files
- I wrote, tested and ran the program using VS Code

# Road Map

A future improvement to implemement would be to add more photos to the picture folder and implement diagonal facing Pac Men when the Pac Man is traveling either up or down diagonally.
